## Description



One of my largest games and one I take a lot of pride in. This was the largest team I have ever worked with and we created an Auto-Battler Card opening game with Dinosaurs. As lead programmer I did a lot of the mechanics and enemy AI to create the strategic depth of the game as well as create the "auto" part in Auto-Battler.
