## Description



My first networking game with a larger team. A three player Chase 'em that involves a diver fixing machines underwater, an engineer in the submarine to guide the diver, and the creature who tries to hunt the diver. I spent a lot of time learning how Networking works in Unreal and made a functioning lobby system that can assign roles to each player as well as create all the tasks the Engineer does in the submarine.
