## Description



GameArchitectureFinal:
A final that turned out way better than expected. A Turn-Based RPG made from Visual Studio and a library alone, no game engine. The game had an animation manager to go through sprite sheets of characters as well as many other gameplay mechanics I programmed in like saving.
